Describe how you would build a logistic regression model to predict the probability of a bid winning (win) 
based on the other columns. 
What features would you select and why?

Ans - To bulid alogistic regression model -

Basics step i can follow is 

1) Data preprocessing

Handle missing values.
Encode categorical features like bidder etc
scale numerical features

2) Feature Selection 

Select features like bid amount reponse count etc
create a basic binary target variable

3) Model training

split data
use logistic regression model

4) Evaluating

check accuracy also check test sets
use classificatiion model

This approach can train a model to predict the probabilty of bid winning.
